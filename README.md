# MC-CP
This repository contains code from my paper on our Monte-Carlo Conformal Prediction (MC-CP) method.

### Introduction
This repository contains the following files:
* `AAAISupplementaryCode.ipynb` - A detailed jupyter notebook that will run a reader through how to use our proposed methods.
* `Concrete_Data.csv` - Supplementary data for regression.
* `abalone.data.csv` - Supplementary data for regression.
